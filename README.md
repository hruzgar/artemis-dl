**Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository!** As a student at TUM utilizing the Tum Artemis platform, I felt the need to create a way to permanently archive all of your exercises. I believe in the value of preserving knowledge, so I designed this tool to ensure I, and others, can download and access these exercises indefinitely - even 30 years down the road. This tool creates a *completely local copy* of exercises and doesn't require any third party service to ensure the longevity.

Features:
- **Dark-Mode PDFs:** Download exercises preserving the dark theme.
- **Exercise Repositories:** Finds and downloads repositories (even hidden ones) of exercises directly from Tum Artemis.
- **One-command Course Download:** And all of this with only *one command!!*. Download full Artemis-Courses with a single command, creating a lasting local archive.

Further down, you'll encounter step-by-step installation instructions and additional details to assist in your setup. Here's to preserving our academic endeavors for the future!
